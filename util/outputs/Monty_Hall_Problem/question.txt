Imagine you're on a game show, and there are three doors in front of you. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You don't know what's behind any of the doors. You get to choose one door. Let's say you pick Door #1. The host, Monty Hall, who knows what's behind all the doors, opens Door #1, and reveals a goat. Now, you have two doors left: Door #3 and Door #2. You pick Door #3. Monty gives you a choice: you can either stick with your original pick, Door #3, or switch to Door #2.
