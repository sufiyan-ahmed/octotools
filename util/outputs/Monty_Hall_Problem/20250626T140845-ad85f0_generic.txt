In this scenario, it seems like there's a bit of a mix-up in the sequence of events compared to the classic "Monty Hall problem." To clarify, let's address what normally happens in this well-known probability puzzle and how you should ideally approach choosing a door.

The classic Monty Hall problem works as follows:

1. You choose one of the three doors. Suppose you initially choose Door #1.
2. Monty Hall, the host who knows what's behind all the doors, then opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat. For example, he opens Door #2, leaving Doors #1 and #3.
3. You are now given the choice to either stick with your original choice (Door #1) or switch to the other remaining door (Door #3).

In the standard version, Monty does not open the door you initially chose; instead, he always opens another door with a goat. Here, you've described Monty opening Door #1 right after you picked it, which leaves you with an unusual situation since your initially picked door had a goat, contrary to the standard format.

Given your scenario:

- You initially chose Door #1, and Monty revealed it as having a goat.
- Now you're left with Doors #2 and #3, with Monty offering you the choice to switch your pick to Door #2 after you first chose Door #3 as your next choice.

Since the classic problem and its assumptions involve a choice between either sticking with your initial choice or switching after a door is revealed, and given Monty has already shown you a goat behind your original choice, you should default to the statistically advantageous choice from the original problem. 

The customary strategy, based on the standard Monty Hall problem logic, suggests that switching doors gives a 2/3 chance of winning the car, versus a 1/3 chance if you stay with your original choice.

Therefore:

- Since you've selected Door #3 after seeing a goat at your original choice of Door #1, the best option is to switch your current choice to Door #2, provided Monty's actions still align with revealing a goat and offering the switch advantage.

Remember, this analysis is based on the classical and most beneficial decision-making strategy for the original structured scenario.
