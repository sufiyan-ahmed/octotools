To solve the river crossing puzzle, the farmer must transport the wolf, goat, and cabbage across the river without any of them being eaten. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **First Trip:** The farmer takes the goat across the river and leaves it on the other side.
   
2. **Second Trip:** The farmer returns alone to the original side.

3. **Third Trip:** The farmer takes the wolf across the river.

4. **Fourth Trip:** The farmer leaves the wolf on the other side but takes the goat back with him to the original side.

5. **Fifth Trip:** The farmer leaves the goat on the original side and takes the cabbage across the river.

6. **Sixth Trip:** The farmer leaves the cabbage with the wolf on the other side and returns alone to the original side.

7. **Seventh Trip:** Finally, the farmer takes the goat across the river one last time.

By following these steps, the farmer successfully transports all three items across the river without any of them being eaten.
