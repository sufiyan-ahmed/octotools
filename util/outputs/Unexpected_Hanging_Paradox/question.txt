Imagine a judge tells a prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to the prisoner. The prisoner will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner tells him on Monday of that week. The prisoner deduces that he will never be hanged by surprise because because he would know the day beforehand. The prisoner is executed on a Friday. Was the execution a surprise to the prisoner?
