This is a classic example of a logical paradox known as the "Barber Paradox." The paradox arises from attempting to apply a self-referential rule to a situation that cannot logically be resolved. Here's why it poses a problem:

- If the barber shaves himself, then according to the rule, he should not shave himself because the rule states that he shaves only those men in town who do not shave themselves.
- Conversely, if the barber does not shave himself, then he must shave himself because he shaves all men in town who do not shave themselves.

This creates a contradiction either way, and thus, there is no consistent answer under the given rule. This paradox is similar in nature to other self-referential paradoxes, such as Russell's Paradox in set theory.
